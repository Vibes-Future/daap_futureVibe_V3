# üîß USDC Purchase Error Fix

**Error:** `Custom error 3012` when buying with USDC  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**  
**Date:** October 12, 2025  

---

## üêõ The Problem

Users were getting this error when trying to purchase with USDC:

```
‚ùå USDC Simulation error: {"InstructionError":[0,{"Custom":3012}]}
```

### Error Code Analysis

- **Error Code:** 3012
- **Meaning:** SPL Token program error - "InvalidAccountData" or "InsufficientFunds"
- **Root Cause:** The buyer's USDC Associated Token Account (ATA) **did not exist**

---

## üí° Why This Happened

### SOL vs USDC: Key Difference

| Purchase Type | Requires ATA? | How It Works |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Buy with SOL** | ‚ùå NO | Uses native SOL directly from wallet |
| **Buy with USDC** | ‚úÖ YES | Requires USDC token account (ATA) |

### The Missing Piece

When a user buys with USDC for the first time:

1. ‚úÖ User has USDC in their wallet (via bridge, exchange, etc.)
2. ‚ùå User does **NOT** have a USDC Associated Token Account yet
3. ‚ùå Transaction fails because the ATA doesn't exist

**Before the fix:**
```
User Wallet ‚Üí [No USDC ATA] ‚Üí ‚ùå Transaction fails with error 3012
```

**After the fix:**
```
User Wallet ‚Üí [Auto-create USDC ATA] ‚Üí [Transfer USDC] ‚Üí ‚úÖ Transaction succeeds
```

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Automatic ATA Creation

The code now:

1. **Detects** if the buyer's USDC ATA exists
2. **Creates** it automatically if missing
3. **Proceeds** with the purchase transaction

### Implementation

```javascript
// Check if USDC ATA exists
let needsAtaCreation = false;
const usdcInfo = await this.connection.getAccountInfo(buyerUsdcAccount);

if (!usdcInfo) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è USDC ATA does not exist - will create it automatically');
    needsAtaCreation = true;
}

// Add ATA creation instruction if needed
if (needsAtaCreation) {
    console.log('üî® Creating USDC Associated Token Account...');
    
    const createAtaIx = {
        programId: associatedTokenProgram,
        keys: [
            { pubkey: wallet, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },     // payer
            { pubkey: buyerUsdcAccount, isSigner: false, isWritable: true }, // ATA
            { pubkey: wallet, isSigner: false, isWritable: false },   // owner
            { pubkey: usdcMint, isSigner: false, isWritable: false }, // mint
            { pubkey: SystemProgram.programId, isSigner: false, isWritable: false },
            { pubkey: tokenProgram, isSigner: false, isWritable: false }
        ],
        data: Buffer.from([])
    };
    
    transaction.add(createAtaIx);
}

// Add the buy instruction
transaction.add(buyInstruction);
```

## üéØ What Changed

### File: `src/js/direct-contract.js`

**Location:** Lines ~456-518 in `buyWithUsdc()` function

**Changes:**

1. **Detection Logic (Lines 456-486):**
   ```javascript
   // Check and create USDC ATA if needed
   let needsAtaCreation = false;
   try {
       const usdcInfo = await this.connection.getAccountInfo(buyerUsdcAccount);
       if (!usdcInfo) {
           needsAtaCreation = true;
       }
   } catch (error) {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

2. **Balance Check (Lines 465-470):**
   ```javascript
   const balance = await this.connection.getTokenAccountBalance(buyerUsdcAccount);
   
   if (balance.value.uiAmount < amount) {
       throw new Error(`Insufficient USDC balance. You have ${balance.value.uiAmount} USDC but trying to spend ${amount} USDC`);
   }
   ```

3. **ATA Creation (Lines 494-518):**
   ```javascript
   if (needsAtaCreation) {
       const createAtaIx = {
           programId: associatedTokenProgram,
           keys: [/* account keys */],
           data: Buffer.from([])
       };
       transaction.add(createAtaIx);
   }
   ```

## üìä Transaction Flow

### Before Fix

```
1. User clicks "Buy with USDC"
2. Frontend creates buy instruction
3. Tries to transfer from non-existent ATA
4. ‚ùå Transaction fails with error 3012
5. User sees error, can't complete purchase
```

### After Fix

```
1. User clicks "Buy with USDC"
2. Frontend checks if USDC ATA exists
3. If missing ‚Üí Add "Create ATA" instruction
4. Add "Buy with USDC" instruction
5. Submit transaction with both instructions
6. ‚úÖ ATA created + Purchase completed atomically
```

## üîç User Experience

### What Users See Now

**First USDC Purchase:**
```
1. Enter USDC amount
2. Click "Buy with USDC"
3. See: "üî® Creating USDC Associated Token Account..."
4. See: "‚úÖ ATA creation instruction added"
5. Approve transaction in wallet
6. ‚úÖ Purchase successful!
```

**Subsequent USDC Purchases:**
```
1. Enter USDC amount
2. Click "Buy with USDC"
3. See: "üìç Buyer USDC account exists: true"
4. Approve transaction in wallet
5. ‚úÖ Purchase successful!
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Messages Improved

### Insufficient USDC Balance

**Before:**
```
‚ùå USDC Simulation error: {"InstructionError":[0,{"Custom":3012}]}
```

**After:**
```
‚ùå Insufficient USDC balance. You have 5.50 USDC but trying to spend 10.00 USDC
```

### Missing ATA (Now Auto-Fixed)

**Before:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è USDC account does not exist - may need to create ATA first
[Transaction fails]
```

**After:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è USDC ATA does not exist - will create it automatically
üî® Creating USDC Associated Token Account...
‚úÖ ATA creation instruction added
[Transaction succeeds]
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenario 1: New User (No USDC ATA)

```bash
# Prerequisites:
- User has USDC in wallet (bridged from Ethereum, bought on exchange, etc.)
- User has never used USDC in this app before
- User has enough SOL for transaction fees (~0.002 SOL)

# Steps:
1. Connect wallet
2. Enter USDC amount (e.g., 10 USDC)
3. Click "Buy with USDC"
4. Approve transaction

# Expected Result:
‚úÖ Transaction includes 2 instructions:
   1. Create USDC ATA
   2. Buy with USDC
‚úÖ Purchase completes successfully
‚úÖ User receives VIBES tokens
```

### Test Scenario 2: Existing User (Has USDC ATA)

```bash
# Prerequisites:
- User already has USDC ATA (from previous transaction)
- User has USDC balance

# Steps:
1. Connect wallet
2. Enter USDC amount
3. Click "Buy with USDC"
4. Approve transaction

# Expected Result:
‚úÖ Transaction includes 1 instruction:
   - Buy with USDC
‚úÖ Purchase completes successfully
‚úÖ No ATA creation needed (already exists)
```

### Test Scenario 3: Insufficient USDC

```bash
# Prerequisites:
- User has USDC ATA
- User has less USDC than trying to spend

# Steps:
1. Connect wallet
2. Enter USDC amount (more than balance)
3. Click "Buy with USDC"

# Expected Result:
‚ùå Clear error message before transaction:
   "Insufficient USDC balance. You have X USDC but trying to spend Y USDC"
‚ùå Transaction not sent (fails at simulation)
```

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

### Transaction Costs

| Action | SOL Cost | When |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Create USDC ATA** | ~0.002 SOL | First USDC purchase only |
| **Buy with USDC** | ~0.000005 SOL | Every purchase |
| **Total (first time)** | ~0.002005 SOL | One-time |
| **Total (subsequent)** | ~0.000005 SOL | Every time |

**Note:** ATA creation is a **one-time cost** per user

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Why This Is Safe

1. **User Authorization:** User must approve the transaction
2. **Atomic Execution:** ATA creation and purchase happen in same transaction
3. **Standard Program:** Uses official AssociatedTokenProgram
4. **No Custody:** User maintains full control of their USDC
5. **Verified Accounts:** All destination accounts verified on-chain

### Program IDs Used

```javascript
// Official Solana programs
const TOKEN_PROGRAM = 'TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA';
const ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM = 'ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL';
const SYSTEM_PROGRAM = '11111111111111111111111111111111';
```

## üìö Technical Deep Dive

### What Is an Associated Token Account (ATA)?

An ATA is a special account that:
- Holds SPL tokens for a specific wallet
- Has a deterministic address (derived from wallet + mint)
- Must be created before receiving tokens
- Requires rent (~0.002 SOL, recoverable)

### ATA Address Derivation

```javascript
const [ata] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
    [
        wallet.toBytes(),          // Owner's public key
        TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBytes(), // Token program
        mint.toBytes()              // USDC mint address
    ],
    ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);
```

### Why ATAs Are Needed

**Native SOL:**
- Stored directly in wallet account
- No additional account needed
- Always ready to use

**SPL Tokens (like USDC):**
- Require separate token account
- One account per token type
- Must be explicitly created
- Uses Associated Token Program for standardization
