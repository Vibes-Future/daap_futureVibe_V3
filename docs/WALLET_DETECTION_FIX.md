# Wallet Detection & Connection Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Trust Wallet Not Detected** - Added multiple detection methods for Trust Wallet
2. **Connection Failures** - Improved connection handling for different wallet types
3. **Public Key Retrieval** - Enhanced public key extraction from various wallet responses

---

## Changes Made

### File: `src/js/solana-wallet-standard.js`

### 1. Enhanced Trust Wallet Detection

**Problem:** Trust Wallet injects itself differently depending on the browser and version.

**Solution:** Added three detection methods:

```javascript
// Method 1: window.trustwallet.solana (most common)
if (window.trustwallet?.solana) { ... }

// Method 2: window.solana with isTrust flag
else if (window.solana?.isTrust) { ... }

// Method 3: window.solana with isTrustWallet flag
else if (window.solana?.isTrustWallet) { ... }
```

### 2. Duplicate Detection Prevention

Added a `Set` to track detected wallet types and prevent duplicates:

```javascript
const detectedTypes = new Set();

// Check each wallet and mark as detected
if (window.solana?.isPhantom && !detectedTypes.has('phantom')) {
    // Add wallet...
    detectedTypes.add('phantom');
}
```

### 3. Improved Connection Handling

Enhanced the `connect()` method to handle different wallet response types:

```javascript
// Get public key - try multiple methods
this.publicKey = null;

// Method 1: From response
if (response?.publicKey) {
    this.publicKey = response.publicKey;
}
// Method 2: From adapter directly
else if (selectedWallet.adapter.publicKey) {
    this.publicKey = selectedWallet.adapter.publicKey;
}
// Method 3: Check if response IS the publicKey
else if (response && typeof response.toBase58 === 'function') {
    this.publicKey = response;
}
```

### 4. Connection Error Recovery

Added fallback for already-connected wallets:

```javascript
try {
    response = await selectedWallet.adapter.connect();
} catch (connectError) {
    // If connect() fails, check if wallet is already connected
    if (selectedWallet.adapter.publicKey && selectedWallet.adapter.isConnected) {
        console.log('📍 Wallet was already connected');
        response = { publicKey: selectedWallet.adapter.publicKey };
    } else {
        throw connectError;
    }
}
```

### 5. Debug Logging

Added detailed logging to help diagnose detection issues:

```javascript
// Debug: Log all window.solana properties
if (window.solana && this.availableWallets.length > 0) {
    const solanaProps = Object.keys(window.solana).filter(key => 
        key.toLowerCase().includes('trust') || 
        key.toLowerCase().includes('is') ||
        key.toLowerCase().includes('name')
    );
    if (solanaProps.length > 0) {
        console.log('🔍 window.solana detection properties:', solanaProps);
    }
}
```

## Debugging Trust Wallet Detection

If Trust Wallet is still not detected, use the debug tool:

### Step 1: Open Debug Page

1. Navigate to: `/debug-wallet-detection.html`
2. Open it in **Trust Wallet's in-app browser**
3. The page will automatically run detection tests

### Step 2: Check Results

The debug page will show:

- ✅ Which wallets are detected
- 🔍 All `window.solana` properties
- 🔍 All `window.trustwallet` properties
- 📋 Complete console output

### Step 3: Share Results

1. Click "📋 Copy Results" button
2. Share the output with the developer
3. This will help identify how Trust Wallet injects itself

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test with Trust Wallet

1. **Open Trust Wallet App** on mobile device
2. **Navigate to DApp** using Trust Wallet's browser
3. **Open Console** (if available) or use debug page
4. **Check Detection:**
   - Should see: "✅ Trust Wallet detected"
   - Should see: "📊 Total wallets detected: 3" (or more)

5. **Try Connection:**
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Select "Trust Wallet"
   - Should see: "✅ Wallet connected successfully"

### Test with Phantom Wallet

1. Open Phantom browser extension
2. Connect to the dApp
3. Should connect without issues (no regression)

### Test with Solflare Wallet

1. Open Solflare browser extension
2. Connect to the dApp
3. Should connect without issues (no regression)

---

## Expected Console Output

### Successful Detection (3 Wallets)

```
✅ Phantom wallet detected
✅ Trust Wallet detected (trustwallet.solana)
✅ Solflare wallet detected
📊 Total wallets detected: 3
```

### Successful Connection

```
🔌 Connecting to Trust Wallet...
📦 Connection response: { publicKey: PublicKey {...} }
✅ Wallet connected successfully: ABC...XYZ
💾 Saved connection preference: Trust Wallet
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Trust Wallet Still Not Detected

**Possible Causes:**
1. Using desktop browser instead of Trust Wallet's in-app browser
2. Trust Wallet not properly installed or activated
3. Trust Wallet uses a different injection method (new version)

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you're using Trust Wallet's **in-app browser**
2. Update Trust Wallet to latest version
3. Run the debug tool and share results
4. Check if `window.trustwallet` or `window.solana` exists in console

### Problem: Connection Fails

**Possible Causes:**
1. Wallet popup was blocked
2. User rejected connection
3. Wallet is locked

**Solutions:**
1. Check if popup blocker is active
2. Try connecting again and approve in wallet
3. Unlock wallet and retry

### Problem: "No Solana wallet detected"

**Causes:**
- No wallet extension installed
- Wallet not loaded yet
- Script loaded before wallet injection

**Solutions:**
1. Install Phantom, Solflare, or Trust Wallet
2. Refresh the page
3. Wait a few seconds and try again (wallets may load late)

---

## Technical Details

### Wallet Injection Timing

Wallets inject themselves at different times:
- **Phantom**: Usually available on page load
- **Solflare**: Available shortly after page load
- **Trust Wallet**: May load after a delay

Our code handles this by:
1. Detecting on initialization
2. Re-detecting after 1 second
3. Re-detecting before each connection attempt

### Priority Order

Wallets are detected in this order:
1. Phantom (most common)
2. Trust Wallet (3 methods)
3. Solflare
4. Coinbase Wallet
5. Backpack

### Duplicate Prevention

If multiple wallets are installed and inject using the same object (e.g., both trying to use `window.solana`), we:
1. Give priority to the first detected
2. Use the `detectedTypes` Set to prevent duplicates
3. Check specific flags (`isPhantom`, `isTrust`, etc.) to differentiate

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Trust Wallet** using the in-app browser
2. **Run Debug Tool** if issues persist: `debug-wallet-detection.html`
3. **Share Console Output** if Trust Wallet is not detected
4. **Verify Other Wallets** still work (Phantom, Solflare)
