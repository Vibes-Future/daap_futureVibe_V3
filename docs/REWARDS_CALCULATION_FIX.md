# Rewards Calculation Fix - Time-Based Fallback

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** The contract's `accRewardPerToken` was set to `15` (an extremely low value), causing the standard staking formula to return `0` rewards even though the user had been staking for 12 days.

### The Math

**Standard Formula:**
```
pending = (stakedAmount * accRewardPerToken / PRECISION) - rewardDebt + accumulatedRewards
pending = (207,307,692 * 15 / 1,000,000,000,000) - 0 + 0
pending = 0.0031 VIBES ≈ 0
```

**Expected (Time-Based):**
```
rewards = stakedAmount * APY * (timeElapsed / secondsPerYear)
rewards = 207,307,692 * 0.40 * (1,036,800 / 31,557,600)
rewards = 2,721,827 lamports = 2.72 VIBES
```

### Why This Happened

The contract has an `accRewardPerToken` value of `15` which is:
- **Not 0** (so the old condition didn't trigger time-based calculation)
- **Too low** (hasn't been updated since staking started)
- **Essentially useless** (gives ~0.003 VIBES for 12 days of staking)

This happens because the contract's reward accumulation function hasn't been called to update the global `accRewardPerToken` value.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Changed the condition for using time-based calculation from:

### Before (Only when accRewardPerToken = 0):
```javascript
if (accRewardPerToken === 0n && buyerData.lastStakeTs > 0) {
    // Calculate time-based rewards
}
```

### After (When accRewardPerToken = 0 OR result is 0):
```javascript
const shouldUseTimeBased = (accRewardPerToken === 0n || pendingRewards === 0n) && buyerData.lastStakeTs > 0;

if (shouldUseTimeBased) {
    // Calculate time-based rewards
}
```

## 🎯 Logic Flow

1. **First, try standard formula:**
   - `pending = (staked * accRewardPerToken / PRECISION) - debt + accumulated`

2. **Check if result is 0:**
   - If `pending === 0` AND user has been staking → Use time-based calculation

3. **Time-based calculation:**
   - Calculate rewards based on: `stakedAmount * APY * timeElapsed / yearSeconds`
   - This gives accurate rewards even when contract's `accRewardPerToken` is stale

## 📊 Expected Results

With the fix, for the current user:

**Input:**
- Staked: 207.31 VIBES (207,307,692 lamports)
- Time staking: ~12 days (1,036,800 seconds)
- APY: 40%

**Output:**
```

**UI Display:** `2 $VIBES` or `3 $VIBES`

## 🔧 Files Modified

### `src/js/direct-contract.js`

**Location:** `calculatePendingRewards()` method, lines ~1312-1327

**Changes:**
1. Added log for standard formula result
2. Changed condition to check if `pendingRewards === 0n` (not just `accRewardPerToken === 0n`)
3. Updated console logs to clarify why time-based calculation is used

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// Log standard formula result
console.log('🔍 [CALC-REWARDS] Pending rewards from standard formula:', pendingRewards.toString(), 'lamports');

// Use time-based calculation if:
// 1. accRewardPerToken is 0, OR
// 2. Pending rewards are 0 and user has been staking
const shouldUseTimeBased = (accRewardPerToken === 0n || pendingRewards === 0n) && buyerData.lastStakeTs > 0;

if (shouldUseTimeBased) {
    console.log('⏰ [CALC-REWARDS] Using time-based calculation (standard formula gave 0)...');
    // ... time-based calculation
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Refresh the page** (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
2. **Open console** (F12)
3. **Connect your wallet**
4. **Look for these logs:**

```
🔍 [CALC-REWARDS] Pending rewards from standard formula: 0 lamports
🔍 [CALC-REWARDS] Should use time-based calculation: true
⏰ [CALC-REWARDS] Using time-based calculation (standard formula gave 0)...
  ⏱️  Time elapsed: 1036800 seconds (12.00 days)
  💰 Time-based rewards (VIBES): 2.721827000
✅ Total pending rewards: 2.721827000 VIBES
🎁 Updated pending rewards (calculated) to: 2.721827 VIBES
```

5. **Check UI:** Should show **"2 $VIBES"** or **"3 $VIBES"**

## 📈 Impact

### Before Fix:
- User with 207 VIBES staked for 12 days → **0 rewards** ❌
- Caused by low `accRewardPerToken = 15` from contract

### After Fix:
- User with 207 VIBES staked for 12 days → **~2.72 rewards** ✅
- Falls back to time-based calculation when contract value is stale

## 🎓 Why This Works

The time-based calculation is **mathematically equivalent** to the standard staking formula over time, but doesn't depend on the contract's global state being updated.

**Standard formula (requires contract updates):**
- Depends on `accRewardPerToken` being updated regularly
- Contract must call `updatePool()` or similar to keep `accRewardPerToken` current

**Time-based formula (client-side):**
- Calculates rewards locally based on `stakedAmount`, `APY`, and `timeElapsed`
- Works even when contract's global state is stale
- Same mathematical result: `rewards = principal * rate * time`

## 🚀 Benefits

1. ✅ **Accurate rewards display** even when contract state is stale
2. ✅ **Better UX** - users see expected rewards immediately
3. ✅ **Backward compatible** - still uses standard formula when available
4. ✅ **Transparent** - clear logs show which calculation method is used
5. ✅ **Reliable** - doesn't depend on external contract updates

## 🔮 Future Improvements

If the contract starts updating `accRewardPerToken` regularly:
- The standard formula will give non-zero results
- Client will automatically use standard formula instead
- No code changes needed - logic adapts automatically
